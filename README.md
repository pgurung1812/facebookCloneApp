How It's Made:

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, EJS

Optimizations

(optional)

when listing all the posts made by the users that current logged in user is following, it would definitely be a good idea to list each post's authors, comments made on the post. also, listing all the users current users is following would add to its appeal. also, I should only allow deleting the posts by their authors. letting users either post text or images would be a great addition too.

Lessons Learned:

I developed the attitude of never giving up even when faced with number of errors whiled developing the program. I was having trouble with updating the users following list by current user. Through various trial and error, I finally came up with the solution of using array to store the list and sending the list to the front end to display the list.

Examples:

Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
